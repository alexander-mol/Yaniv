x streets out
x streets in (hard)
x draw card = discarded card quick flip (easy)
x scoring across rounds (easy)
x multiprocessing for ga - 4x improvement
x Yaniv caller gets to start next round
x BasePlayer draw from discard pile if can get a double (medium, need player.think)
x BasePlayer draw from discard pile if can get a straight (medium)
- clean up BasePlayer (maybe need utils)
- clean up Game
- multiples of 50 halve scores
- immediate discard can only happen after playing a single card, and can't happen after drawing from discard pile
